## Intro

I had an idea that the share of stablecoins could be used to quantify the amount of dry powder in the
crypto market.
So I went to [tradingview](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-USDT.D/)
and yes it appears that a jump in stablecoin dominance began in mid 2020, peaking in September and then
began dropping, coinciding with the bull run of January 2021.
The concept is that breaks in stablecoin dominance can predict larger market moves, eg risk on/off.

This page is designed to be updated daily - today's date is shown below.

Reminder: this is not financial advice.

## Get data

We will be simplifying things by working only with the market cap of the top two stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) against cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).

Here is a graph of the market cap of these assets since 2019.

As you can see in the second chart, stablecoin market cap is increasing dramatically.

This represents the phenomenon that stablecoins are becoming an important part of the crypto ecosystem.
This could be driven by utility as a medium of exchange without borders, as a vehicle for earning high 
interest, or simply a way to avoid currency debasement in vulnerable countries 
like Venezuela, Lebanon and Turkey.
It seems natural that some of this money will find it's way into existing crypto assets once the market
gains momentum again.

```{r,getdata,fig.height=8,fig.width=8}

mydate <- Sys.Date()-1

BTCURL=paste("https://web-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/ohlcv/historical?symbol=BTC&convert=USD&interval=daily&time_start=2019-01-01&time_end=",mydate,sep="")

USDTURL=paste("https://web-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/ohlcv/historical?symbol=USDT&convert=USD&interval=daily&time_start=2019-01-01&time_end=",mydate,sep="")
download.file(USDTURL,destfile="usdtdat.txt")
usdtdat <- fromJSON("usdtdat.txt")
usdt_mc <- usdtdat$data$quotes$quote$USD$market_cap

download.file(USDCURL,destfile="usdcdat.txt")
usdcdat <- fromJSON("usdcdat.txt")
usdc_mc <- usdcdat$data$quotes$quote$USD$market_cap

times_mc <- btcdat$data$quotes$quote$USD$timestamp
mc <- data.frame(times_mc,btc_mc,eth_mc,usdt_mc,usdc_mc)

mc$total <- mc$btc_mc + mc$eth_mc + mc$usdt_mc + mc$usdc_mc
mc$sc <- mc$usdt_mc + mc$usdc_mc
mc$scrat <- mc$sc / mc$total
mc$times_mc <- as.character(mc$times_mc)
mc$times_mc <- as.Date(sapply(strsplit(mc$times_mc,"T"),"[[",1))

plot(mc$times_mc,mc$btc_mc,type="l",col="orange",
  ylab="market cap (USD)",main="Major crypto and stable asset market cap")
lines(mc$times_mc,mc$eth_mc,col="blue")
lines(mc$times_mc,mc$usdt_mc,col="green")
lines(mc$times_mc,mc$usdc_mc,col="red")
legend("topleft", legend=c("BTC", "ETH", "USDT", "USDC"),
       col=c("orange", "blue", "green", "red"), lty=1:4)
grid()

plot(mc$times_mc,mc$usdt_mc,type="l",col="green",
  ylab="market cap (USD)",main="Major stable asset market cap")
lines(mc$times_mc,mc$usdc_mc,col="red")
legend("topleft", legend=c("USDT", "USDC"),
       col=c("green", "red"), lty=1:4)
grid()

```

## Now chart the stablecoin dominance

We can see that the dominance is in an overall upward direction, but since 2022 it has been on an 
absolute tear.

The chart below is interactive, so you can hover over points, zoom in, that sort of thing.

```{r,scdom,fig.height=8,fig.width=8}

p <- ggplot(mc, aes(x=times_mc, y=scrat)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("stablecoin dominance")

ggplotly(p)

```

## Notes

So can stablecoin dominance be used to predict major risk on/off momentum changes? Yes, I think it can,
along with other momentum indicators, so watch these levels closely.
