## Intro

So far we have analysed each cryptocurrency separately, but in this analysis I will
be downloading price data from a basket of cryptocurrencies and combining it into a
massive series that I will then analyse with my existing indicators.

```{r,lib}

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library("parallel")
  library("jsonlite")
  library("tidyverse")
  library("runner")
  library("quantmod")
  library("TTR")
  library("vioplot")
  library("kableExtra")
})

Sys.Date()

```

Reminder: this is not financial advice.

## Get data

Obtaining historical data (daily) from CoinMarketCap.com for a basket of cryptocurrencies.

I use a basket of dominant crypto projects as well as some that have struggled.

Total market days is >34000.
Each crypto has >1000 days and most have >3000 days, so it should be a good dataset
to analyze.

Can always add more in future without extensive code changes.

Note that the last price value of each series is repeated 30 times.
This is a washout period that appears between each series.

```{r,getdata}

cryptos <- c("BTC","ETH","BNB","XRP","ADA","DOGE","LTC","XMR","FIL","XTZ","DASH","FTC")

set.seed(300)
cryptos <- sample(cryptos)

message("here is the reshuffles set of cryptos")
cryptos

mydate <- Sys.Date()-1

TICKER=cryptos[1]

prices <- lapply(cryptos,function(TICKER) {
  URL=paste("https://web-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/ohlcv/historical?symbol=",
    TICKER,"&convert=USD&interval=daily&time_start=2010-06-01&time_end=",mydate,sep="")
  download.file(URL,destfile="dat.txt")
  dat <- fromJSON("dat.txt")
  price <- dat$data$quotes
  price <- data.frame(price$time_close, price$quote$USD$high, price$quote$USD$low, price$quote$USD$close,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
  colnames(price) <- c("date","high","low","close")
  price$date <- sapply(strsplit(as.character(price$date),"T"),"[[",1)
  price2 <- price[rep(nrow(price),30),]
  price <- rbind(price,price2)
  Sys.sleep(1)
  return(price)
})

names(prices) <- cryptos
lapply(prices,nrow)
sum(unlist(lapply(prices,nrow)))

```

# relative prices

In order to combine the price series, the following price series needs to be multiplied by a factor
so it begins at the same price as the previous one ends.

So I need to calculate the relative prices based on the start and end price of each series.

It is a bit complicated, so it has a few steps.

```{r,relprice}

for ( i in 2:length(prices) ) {
  prev <- prices[[i-1]][nrow(prices[[i-1]]),"close"]
  new <- prices[[i]][1,"close"]
  prices[[i]] <- prices[[i]][,2:4] * prev/new }

prices[[1]] <- prices[[1]][,2:4]

message("check that normalisation has worked")
lapply(prices,function(x) { c1 <- head(x,1) ; c2 <- tail(x,1) ; rbind(c1,c2) })

combined_price <- do.call(rbind,prices)
rownames(combined_price) <- as.Date(1:nrow(combined_price))
str(combined_price)

head(combined_price)
tail(combined_price)

# save data to file
write.table(combined_price,file="combined_price.csv",sep=",")
saveRDS(combined_price,"combined_price.rds")

```

## Plots

Let's examine some of the trends in the data with some charts.

```{r,plots,fig.height=8,fig.width=8}

plot(combined_price$close ~ as.Date(rownames(combined_price)),
  type="l",log="y",ylab="USD price index",xlab="date (fictional)")

```
