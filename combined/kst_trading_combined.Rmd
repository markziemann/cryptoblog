## Intro

There are many indicators of market momentum, here we will look at one called the Know Sure Thing (KST).

From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/know-sure-thing-kst.asp):

>The Know Sure Thing (KST) is a momentum oscillator developed by Martin Pring to make
rate-of-change readings easier for traders to interpret.
The KST is calculated by taking the simple moving average (SMA) of four different rate-of-change (ROC) periods, adding them together to come up with the KST, and creating a signal line by taking the 9-period SMA of the KST.

Like other indicators, it is an oscillator with a signal line to distinguish bullish and bearish
situations.

There are three input parameters:

* Vector of four SMA periods.

* Vector of four rate of change (ROC) periods.

* Signal line lag.

This could get really complicated if each number was changed, meaning there would be millions of
combinations of input variables.
To make it simpler, for the I will multiply the default SMA and ROC values by a scaling factor, between
0.1 and 3.
The signal line will be varied between 4 and 60 periods.

This page is designed to be updated daily - today's date is shown below.

})

```

Reminder: this is not financial advice.

## Get data

Obtaining combined crypto data generated previously.

```{r,getdata}

price <- readRDS("combined_price.rds")
price$date <- as.Date(rownames(price))
price <- price[,c("date","high","low","close")]

head(price)
tail(price)

```

## Calculate hodl returns

It's important to calculate the returns for simply holding the asset rather than actively trading.

The number shown here is the fold return on investment.

```{r,hodl}

myend <- price[c(1,nrow(price)),4][2]
mystart <- price[c(1,nrow(price)),4][1]
hodl <- (myend - mystart) / mystart
hodl

```

## KST trading function

Here is the function for trading based on KST indicator, buying when short interval indicator
goes above the longer interval line, and sell when it falls below.

All trades are executed at the end of the daily session (UTC midnight).

```{r,kstfunc1}

mykst <- function(price,nScale=1,nrocScale=1,nSig=9,fee=0.005) {
  nn <- c(10, 10, 10, 15) * nScale
  nroc <- c(10, 15, 20, 30) * nrocScale
  kst <- KST(price$close, n = nn, nROC = nroc, nSig = nSig)
  price2 <- price
  price2 <- cbind(price2,kst)
  price2$higher <- price2$kst > price2$signal
  yesterday <- price2$higher
  yesterday <- c(NA,yesterday)
  yesterday <- yesterday[1:(length(yesterday)-1)]
  price2$yesterday <- yesterday
  price2$trade <- price2$higher - price2$yesterday
  price2 <- price2[which(price2$trade!=0),]
  if ( price2$trade[1] == -1 ) { price2 <- price2[2:nrow(price2),] }
  if ( tail(price2,1)$trade ) { price2 <- price2[1:(nrow(price2)-1),] }
  buy <- subset(price2,trade==1)[,c("date","close")]
  colnames(buy) <- c("buy_date","buy_price")
  sell <- subset(price2,trade==-1)[,c("date","close")]
  colnames(sell) <- c("sell_date","sell_price")
  if( nrow(buy) != nrow(sell) ) {
    MIN=min(nrow(buy),nrow(sell))
    buy <- buy[1:MIN,]
    sell <- sell[1:MIN,]
  }
  trades <- cbind(buy,sell)
  trades$diff <- ( ( trades$sell_price - trades$buy_price ) / trades$buy_price ) +1 - ( 2 * fee )
  return(c(prod(trades$diff),nrow(trades)))
}

```

## Backtesting

Now let's go back in time to test the performance of the different interval strategies on the daily
timeframe, here are the ranges tested:

* n1: from 10 to 107 days

* n2: from 3 to 25 days

* n_signal: from 3 to 20 days

Let's assume a 0.5% exchange fee.

There are a lot of possibilities, so the best way to get a feel for the results is to see which combinations of parameters performed best using different
performance metrics.

```{r,backtest1}

fee=0.005

nScale <- seq(1,3,0.1)
nrocScale <- seq(0.1,1,0.02)
nSigs <- seq(5,60,1)

params <- expand.grid(nScale,nrocScale,nSigs)
colnames(params) <- c("nScale","nrocScale","nSigs")

res <- mclapply(X=1:nrow(params) , FUN=function(i) {
  nScale=as.numeric(params[i,1])
  nrocScale=as.numeric(params[i,2])
  nSigs=as.numeric(params[i,3])
  mykst(price,nScale=nScale,nrocScale=nrocScale,nSig=nSigs,fee=fee)
} , mc.cores = CORES )

res <- as.data.frame(do.call(rbind, res))
colnames(res) <- c("returns","trades")
res2 <- cbind(params,res)
res2$returnspertrade <- res2$returns/res2$trades
res2$mean <- res2$returns^(1/res2$trades)

basic <- mykst(price,fee=fee)
basic_returns <- basic[1]
basic_mean <- basic[1]^(1/basic[2])

```

Here are the strategies which had the highest mean return per trade.
These opportunities don't arise often but could be potential opportunities for leveraged trades.

```{r,backtest_res1}

head(res2[order(-res2$mean),],20) %>% kbl(row.names=FALSE) %>%  kable_styling("hover", full_width = F)

```

Here are the strategies which had the highest overall returns.
This involves more frequent trading and the returns on each trade were smaller.
This is less optimal if trades are executed manually.

```{r,backtest_res2}

res2 <- res2[order(-res2$returns),]

head(res2,20) %>% kbl(row.names=FALSE) %>%  kable_styling("hover", full_width = F)

```

## Plots

Another approach to selecting "good" parameters could be to begin with the default values and then
aim to increase returns and decrease the number of trades executed.

The red dot in the chart below indicates the KST with default interval values.
Data points to the upper right side of that dot are strategies with better performance.

```{r,plots1,fig.height=8,fig.width=8}

plot(res2$mean , res2$returns, log="y",xlab="mean ROI", ylab="total returns")
points(basic_mean,basic_returns,col="red",pch=19,cex=2)
abline(h=hodl,col="red")
grid()

```

## Optimised strategy

Here I use the optimised values for n1, n2 and n.signal and we can have a look at all the trades
executed over the years.

```{r,best1,fig.width=10,fig.height=8}

res2 <- subset(res2,mean>1.1)

best_nScale = res2[1,1]
best_nrocScale = res2[1,2]
best_nSigs = res2[1,3]

message(paste("Selected n scale factor:",best_nScale))
message(paste("Selected nROC scale factor:",best_nrocScale))
message(paste("Selected n.signal period:",best_nSigs))

price2 <- price
kst <- KST(price2$close,n=best_nScale * c(10, 10, 10, 15) ,
  nROC= best_nrocScale * c(10, 15, 20, 30),
  nSig=best_nSigs )

price2 <- cbind(price2,kst)
price2$higher <- price2$kst > price2$signal
yesterday <- price2$higher
yesterday <- c(NA,yesterday)
yesterday <- yesterday[1:(length(yesterday)-1)]
price2$yesterday <- yesterday
price2$trade <- price2$higher - price2$yesterday
price2 <- price2[which(price2$trade!=0),]
if ( price2$trade[1] == -1 ) { price2 <- price2[2:nrow(price2),] }
if ( tail(price2,1)$trade ) { price2 <- price2[1:(nrow(price2)-1),] }
buy <- subset(price2,trade==1)[,c("date","close")]
colnames(buy) <- c("buy_date","buy_price")
sell <- subset(price2,trade==-1)[,c("date","close")]
colnames(sell) <- c("sell_date","sell_price")
if( nrow(buy) != nrow(sell) ) {
  MIN=min(nrow(buy),nrow(sell))
  buy <- buy[1:MIN,]
  sell <- sell[1:MIN,]
}
trades <- cbind(buy,sell)
trades$diff <- ( ( trades$sell_price - trades$buy_price ) / trades$buy_price ) +1 - ( 2 * fee )

message(paste("Number of trades:",nrow(trades)))
message(paste("Total ROI:",prod(trades$diff)))
message(paste("Returns over hodl:",prod(trades$diff)/hodl))
message(paste("Mean:",mean(trades$diff)))

trades %>% kbl(row.names=FALSE) %>%  kable_styling()

HEADER="KST"
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(price$close~as.Date(price$date),type="l",log="y",
  xlab="Date",ylab="price (USD)",main="USD price")
grid()

plot(kst[,1] ~ as.Date(price$date),type="l",col="blue",
  xlab="Date",ylab="KST",main="KST")
lines(as.Date(price$date), kst[,2]  , col="red"  )
grid()
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

```

## Effect of fees

It is important to factor in the effect of fees because higher exchange fees will erode profits.

```{r,fees,fig.width=8,fig.height=7}

fee_levels <- c(0,0.0005,0.001,0.002,0.003,0.004,0.005,0.006,0.007,0.008,0.009,0.01)

res_fees <- sapply(fee_levels,function(x) {
  suppressWarnings(
    mykst(price,nScale=nScale,nrocScale=nrocScale,nSig=nSigs,fee=x)
  )

} )

plot(fee_levels,res_fees[1,] ,log="y",pch=19,xlab="fee proportion",ylab="fold return",main="Effect of fees on returns")
abline(h=hodl,col="red")
grid()

```

## Conclusion

There are many approaches to momentum trading.
Here using the KST we have a strategy which scored good performance.
