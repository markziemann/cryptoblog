## Intro

Below we present the results of the backtesting optimisation script using
several momentum indicators on the daily timeframe.

1. SMA: simple moving average. Buy when price exceeds MA line and sell when
it goes under. The parameter is the optimal timeframe for the MA line in days.

2. EMA: just like SMA except using exponential moving average.

3. SMAcross: Uses two simple moving average lines. When the fast line moves
above the slow line, buy. Sell when it goes under. The two numbers represent
the long and short MA intervals (days).

4. EMAcross: Same as above, except exponential moving average lines are used.

5. DMI: Directional movement index (days).

6. TSI: True strength index. The three numbers represent n.first, n.second,
and n.signal.

7. Stoch: Stochastic oscillator. The three numbers represent nFastK, nFastD,
and nSmooth.

8. RSI2: Double RSI, this is a RSIcross strategy. The two numbers represent
short and long intervals.
