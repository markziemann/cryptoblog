## I was wrong about Bitcoin

Over the last few weeks I've come to the realisation that Bitcoin has a fatal flaw.
Since I got involved in this space in 2014, I've been dismissing this issue. 
It didn't really occur to me how problematic it was.
Subconsciously, I was in denial.

I thought bitcoin was this unstoppable phenomenon, money developed with software,
divorced from central government control.
The most resilient computer network in history, allowing p2p commerce, disintermediating
banks, remittance providers, SWIFT and other middlemen, while ushering in a new age of 
financial freedom for millions around the world.
Bitcoin is marketed as "open decentralized, borderless, censorship-resistant, neutral, 
interconnected and p2p cash", and this is partially true, however it is a bit more 
complicated than that.

## The fatal flaw

Let me explain what the issue is.
It is the fact that the blockchain is totally transparent.
In each block, you can see all transaction information; sender address, amount and receiver 
address.
You can scan the blockchain and calculate the balance of every address, every wallet.

You can go to any number of websites, eg: 
[bitinfocharts.com](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)
and see the balance of the richest wallets, along with their recent transactions.
The activities of these parties are free for anyone to see.
Isn't that a problem?

In the Bitcoin whitepaper, it was described as pseudonymous.
As long as you can keep your address secret, your identity remains private.

Remaining private is pretty difficult however, because everyone you interact with can see your
address, and therefore see your balance.

## Why privacy is essential

When you transact with your grocery store, pay for a bus ride, or grab a burger with cash,
what information do you reveal to them?
Not much, just the transaction amount. 
The merchant doesn't get your account number, doesn't know your balance, and doesn't know
who you have been transacting with previously.

What about your credit or debit card, which is compulsory for eBay or Amazon purchases?
They would get the card/account number along with the amount.

What benefit would Bitcoin provide to this scenario?
If executed on bitcoin blockchain it would be slower, more expensive and with the problems 
that it reveals too much of your personal information to transaction partners.
It doesn't sound that useful does it?

That's why the narrative around Bitcoin has changed from "p2p cash" to "digital gold", so you 
don't need to use it for regular transactions, just hodl it.

This isn't really sustainable.

If a currency has no use case as a medium of exchange, then this dramatically 
diminishes it's value.
Much of the value of a currency is the network effect caused by making it a
medium of exchange.
If you ask a merchant to accept payment in a currency, there's a chance they will
say yes, which grows the network by a node.
No medium of exchange, no growth.
This is how reserve currencies grow so dominant!

Even if Bitcoin is a store of value that's not used for everyday transactions, 
like a reserve currency of the internet, the lack of privacy remains an issue.
If you purchase coins from an exchange, of course they know how much you bought
and when.
If you take a fraction of those coins to a new exchange to cash out, then the new exchange 
can see your *self-custodial* wallet balance, along with all the transactions that
wallet has made over the years.
As those exchanges are highly regulated, they need to comply with local authorities,
so information about your self custodial wallet, its balance and past transactions could 
come under scrutiny from governments and their contractors.

## Why Bitcoin will be surveilled to death

You might be in the camp which says that privacy is not that important,
and that you're happy to transact on an open ledger.
That's your choice - but hear this:
Regulated exchanges implementing KYC/AML are collecting information about their
customers including the self-custody wallets they use.
This information is being passed on to law enforcement agencies as the law requires,
and this information is given to chain-analysis companies with an aim to
de-anonymise the blockchain of bitcoin and other cryptos.

So far, these chain-analysis efforts have been aimed at tracking ransoms and stolen funds and 
to prevent money laundering, which is absolutely legitimate, but my fear is that once 
these capabilities are sufficiently developed, the veil of pseudonymity will be completely 
smashed.
Powerful agencies and corporations will collect enough data to be able to identify the owner
of every wallet.
They will be able to surveil their citizens every transaction, as well as citizens globally,
all with the information that users provide on the transparent blockchain together with KYC
exchanges.

How powerful are such chain-analysis tools?
Well take a look at how authorities were able to recover funds from the 120,000 BTC 
[Bitfinex hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Bitfinex_hack) from 2018.
Worth $72 million at the time, those coins were at one point worth $8 billion!
So how come the thieves weren't able to simply send the funds to another exchange
and cash out to a fiat currency?
Simple - the wallets holding these funds were being constantly tracked by the authorities.
Regulated exchanges around the world knew that these wallets were black-listed, and so if 
those funds were ever deposited to an exchange, the exchange could alert authorities.
And thanks to the KYC regulations, the authorities would know who and where to call.

From the original 120,000 BTC stolen, 94,000 were able to be recovered, as the suspects
helpfully uploaded private keys to the wallets on an encrypted cloud drive.
See the [US Justice Department memo on the case](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency)
and [Twitter thread by xenumonero](https://twitter.com/xenumonero/status/1491109587050975233).
The main reason the funds were able to be traced, was the totally transparent nature
of the Bitcoin blockchain.
The suspects controlling the wallet used different techniques to avoid tracking, 
but it was futile:

* making lots of small transactions to make the funds harder to trace

* using a mixer service provided by a darknet marketplace.
A mixer (aka "tumbler" or "coinjoin") is a service that mixes funds from different users and 
outputs them in an effort to make transactions untraceable. 
[See this explainer on what a coinjoin is](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinJoin).

* using decentralised exchanges to swap between cryptocurrencies.

In the end, the suspects were caught when they tried to offload some "laundered" coins on an 
exchange in which they provided their real personal identification info.

So we can conclude that these privacy techniques don't really work, and here's why: they don't
actually obfuscate the sender and receiver addresses, they just make the web of transactions 
a bit larger.
While these techniques may be sufficient to stay one step ahead of law enforcement which is 
"manually" tracing funds, like you might browse a spreadsheet, but it is no match against 
automated software tools that are specifically designed to flag the movements of specific coins. 
Like in this case, when the stolen funds are deposited to an exchange.
It doesn't matter how many times the coins are mixed, or into how many tiny amounts the 
funds are divided, as soon as those "tainted" funds hit a regulated exchange, the alarm 
bells start going off.

It is important to look at whether swapping into other cryptos (or "chain-hopping") provided 
any utility in this case.
If this occurs over a centralized exchange that checks the legitimacy of coins when 
accepting deposits, then no it won't.
Further, if it was a decentralised exchange, then it is likely to leave traces on the 
respective blockchains, particularly if they are both transparent.
It is interesting to note that the Bitfinex suspects did swap some bitcoins into Monero (a 
privacy preserving crypto), but those Monero funds were not traceable once they were withdrawn
from exchanges.
On the other hand, the trail of the bitcoin transactions was completely traced by authorities.

Again, although this is a case of good policing work to catch criminals, it highlights that
if you are a target, there is nowhere to hide on transparent blockchain. 
One day that information might be used by bad actors, to de-anonymise wallets and target 
individuals.

Similarly, the recent [Canadian trucker blockade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_convoy_protest)
highlighted another very important issue.
The blockade was basically a protest against government vaccine mandates, where truckers were
forced to get vaccinated so they could continue to work.
Some truckers were against this move, so they used their vehicles to clog up inner Ottawa, 
which led to problems in the city and a stand-off.
The anti-vax movement supporters used various fundraising tools to strengthen the protest, 
including GoFundMe and GiveSendGo, but the government declared the blockade an illegal 
protest, and with an executive order, those fundraisers were were swiftly shut down by 
authorities, funds were frozen and are unlikely to be returned to the protest organisers.
To circumvent this, protest organisers began accepting bitcoin donations and the funds 
rolled in, however when organisers tried to actually use those funds, by using a local 
regulated exchange to convert the coins into dollars, the government ordered the exchange 
to freeze those funds as well!

Furthermore, as the protests were deemed illegal, the owners of the wallets who made those 
donations are at risk of seeing their exchange accounts and regular bank accounts frozen.

Now I'm not saying that I support the truckers here.
For the record I think the protest was infantile and anti-science.
But the fact that people who supported a cause are now finding themselves potentially in hot 
water is troubling.

What if you want to donate to other causes like Wikileaks or Sci-hub, which arguably are for 
the greater good but donations are illegal in some countries.

This extends not just to donations, but also to your purchases.
If you wanted to buy something deeply personal, like medicine, psychological therapy, 
"adult toy", etc, I'm sure you would like to keep that information private.
You wouldn't want that info published on the blockchain for the world to see.

Furthermore, this new surveillance ability could open the door to insidious discrimination
by employers and merchants against persons based on their previous financial dealings.

## You still think bitcoin is unconfiscatable?

It is often said that bitcoin cannot be seized, but this is overly simplistic.

!["wrench attack", source: XKCD](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png "wrench attack")

If governments, exchanges and your transaction partners can all see your balance and income,
this leaves you vulnerable to extortion.
They don't need to seize your bitcoins, if they know you're stinking rich they'll just take 
something else.
In the case of criminals, they might take you or someone you love hostage.
In the case of the government, they might freeze your regular bank account, or seize your 
house.

To avoid this type of surveillance, we need to use a currency where balances cannot be 
snooped on, and where transaction sender/receiver addresses are obfuscated.
If those bad actors don't know whether you have those digital assets at all, then they won't 
bother to harrass you.

## Why it's going to get worse

Bitcoin and cryptos are still emerging as an asset class and remain small fry in the context
of the market cap of all investments.
At only ~$2 trillion total crypto market cap, and with the space dominated by rampant 
speculation, rather than actual utility, most participants are completely ignoring the 
problem of privacy.
Indeed, privacy protecting cryptos occupy an extremely small portion of this market - at about 
$10 B, or 0.5% of the total.

It seems that while folks are excited about the technological advances that blockchain 
provides, they haven't stopped to think about how it would work out if cryptos became a 
medium of exchange integrated into our daily lives.

Maybe this viewpoint will change with the roll-out of central bank digital currencies around
the world.
[CBDCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency) are digital currencies, 
but are controlled by a central entity (the central bank).
The central bank issues individuals with their account and can issue currency directly to 
individuals.
The central authority can not only see what you're doing with your funds, but can with a 
keystroke subtract funds or freeze the wallet permanently.
In addition, the funds could be controlled in such a way so that they can only be spent at
"approved" retailers, or that the funds will be subject to negative interest rates, or must 
be spent in a certain time period upon which the funds will "expire".

This would be a disaster for personal freedom, but I'm sure it would be presented by 
politicians as a way to boost the economy by forcing regular folk to spend instead of save.
Naturally, CBDCs are being rolled-out most rapidly in authoritarian countries, like China, 
where the CBDC can be used as a tool to control the population, in particular by contributing 
to a person's [social credit score](https://sociable.co/government-and-policy/chinas-digital-currency-help-ccp-punish-coerce-citizens-social-credit-system-cnas/).

Certainly the central banks *might* not share this data to third parties, but so long as
such a dataset exists it will be a huge honeypot that will attract hackers who will try anything 
to get their hands on it.

At least with the current banking system, government agencies at present cannot surveil all 
transactions.
They receive alerts from banks of suspicious activity.
At least in the current system, a warrant is required before funds can be frozen or seized.
Let's hope that if CBDCs are rolled out, that populations will be guaranteed the same due
process.

Another important event that might happen in the next few years is the phasing out of physical
cash.
Cash is on the most part untraceable and resistant to surveillance.
If it were invented today, then it would be sure to be banned.
And most likely it will be phased out soon, or subject to stricter controls, like reducing 
the permitted cash transaction size.
If cash is banned, and your only options are CBDCs and cryptos, then I can see privacy 
oriented cryptos becoming more popular in future.

## Is fungibility an emerging problem for bitcoin?

Fungibility is a key characteristic of money in that one unit is interchangeable for another.
Cars are not fungible because there are many makes and models, but cash is, because two $5 
bills are worth the same as a $10 bill.

I see fungibility becoming an emerging problem with bitcoin.
It started a year or so ago when Kevin O'Leary spoke about how he only wanted to buy bitcoins 
that were newly mined because then he knew they definitely wouldn't be traced back to any 
illicit activity like darknet markets which could see those coins "tainted" and blocked 
from regulated exchanges.
He also spoke about how newly minted bitcoins mined with renewable energy should be worth 
relatively more than those mined with energy from fossil fuels [(link)]([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kevin-o-leary-refuses-bitcoin-123100299.html). 

We're now seeing some folks speculate that coins held by certain groups can be 
blacklisted by governments around the world.
For example, as a result of Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine there are calls for 
"Russian coins" to be blacklisted from Western exchanges.

This raises the prospect that over time, separate markets for these categories of coins will 
emerge, fracturing liquidity and leaving us asking "is this really money?"

Monero enthusiast SethForPrivacy has collected stories of bitcoin's failed fungibility
[here](https://sethforprivacy.com/posts/fungibility-graveyard/), which is definitely
worth a read.

It highlights that while bitcoin is more fungible than cars, it is definitely not as
fungible as physical cash or even electronic money in your bank account.

There are even concerns of possible regulations imposed on miners which will force them to 
censor transactions of certain individuals or geographic regions.

With pricacy-by-default currencies, each unit is indistinguishable from another, so 
lack of fungibility is no longer a problem.

## Is it game-over for Bitcoin?

One of the arguments that bitcoiners make about altcoins is that over time, any worthwhile 
altcoin feature will be incorporated by Bitcoin.
Even I wrote this in an earlier post.
And yes, it is true that Bitcoin is still undergoing development, but the rate at which these 
changes are implemented is extremely slow and incremental.
This slow pace makes sense, as the developers want to ensure that Bitcoin is a reliable system, 
as it supports billions in funds from millions of users.

This slow and incremental development process means that huge changes in blockchain structure 
are not likely to happen in the near future.
The privacy issues of bitcoin were raised in the community in 2013, however precious little 
code changes have been implemented to protect users privacy.

Yes there is some degree of anonymity on the lightning network, a layer two solution, however
there are doubts it will work (which I will discuss in a future post in more detail).

This lack of privacy protection on the main blockchain over the past ten years indicates to 
me that privacy is not something that is a high priority for the Bitcoin developer team, and 
therefore we're not likely to see any major changes in this space any time soon.
Basically, they've had over 10 years to improve user privacy and uphold the cypherpunk
dream of unstoppable p2p cash, but have fallen short. 
When the user base needed anonymous payments to protect their identities, bitcoin was no help
at all.

Indeed, even if it were possible for the Bitcoin project to magically implement private 
transactions, it would certainly trigger a major regulatory crack-down with exchanges 
delisting it, as has been [experienced by privacy coins in Western countries](https://cointelegraph.com/news/australian-exchanges-delist-privacy-coins-amid-chainalysis-integration).
Were this to happen, then it is likely that the value would tank dramatically, which would 
spell disaster for folks using bitcoin as a savings vehicle.
So there is a financial incentive for the Bitcoin developer team to never implement meaningful 
privacy protection on the blockchain.

## What is the endgame here?

I see bitcoin remaining the dominant crypto for several years.
However as the problems I've outlined here become more widely appreciated, it will cease to
play any role as digital cash.
It will be more like a digital commodity or property, with an uncertain use case.

From the cypherpunk worldview, one which fights surveillance and provides the world with
tools to protect communications from eavesdroppers, Bitcoin is a neat proof-of-concept,
but in comparison to privacy preserving cryptos, it looks merely like a prototype.
In contrast, those privacy-by-default cryptos are what Bitcoin *should* have been,
not just "open decentralized, borderless, censorship-resistant, neutral,
interconnected and p2p cash" but all those things, together with the protections that
privacy affords.

I would like to say that such privacy preserving cryptos would simply supercede the existing
top-tier cryptos in their popularity and market cap, however disruption like this is 
is unlikely to occur in an orderly changing of the guard.

Firstly consider why privacy cryptos are only worth half of a percent of the total crypto
market cap.
This is mostly due to regulatory restrictions.
Consider Monero, the largest privacy coin - it is available on only four exchanges!
And in addition to that, the largest exchange only offers it to some of its customer's
countries.
With so few onramps, there is a distinct lack of liquidity, which has been a major victory
for regulators.

Secondly, the public perception of privacy coins is that they are simply vehicles for
criminals and tax dodgers looking to cover their tracks.
This is not unlike bitcoin in the early days which was used on darknet markets and was 
regarded as anonymous cash.

So how are privacy preserving cryptos going to rise to supremacy?
Of course there's no crystal ball, but I see two drivers for this.

Number 1 - organic growth.
I see that the privacy crypto community is an extremely small but vibrant, dynamic and 
intellectually honest bunch and that they realise that it is up to them to spread the word 
about the importance of crypto privacy.
They are proactive in using monero and other cryptos for their merchant payments and 
their paychecks.
They realise the importance of growing the network to grow the value.
But most of all, they know that they must eschew the popular "number go up" contemporary 
crypto culture in favour of "freedom go up".

Number 2 - disruptive events.
The trucker thing was a kind of watershed moment for me, and events like these will continue
to happen. 
Events where private cash will help regular folks resist authoritarian and totalitarian 
states.
Events where private cash will help regular folks avoid financial ruin under the rule of 
incompetent governments.

Now if you think that corruption and authoritarianism only affects a few poorer countries
you would be wrong. 
According to [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2022/global-expansion-authoritarian-rule)
only 20% of the world population lives in in a "free" country, with the remainder living
in "partly free" and "not free", and the direction of change over the past 20 years has 
been relentlessly negative.
So if you live in a wealthy free country with access to financial services you need to recognise
the ridiculous level of privilege you have in comparison.

I see a day, some ten years from now, when privacy protecting cryptos emerge as the standard for 
commerce, smart contracts and investments.
But for this to happen we first need to recognise that privacy is a human right.
We need to get back to the roots of the cypherpunk movement which values freedoms, not financial gains.
