## Preface

The world of cryptocurrency can be an intimidating place, with frequent negative
stories in the media, and misunderstandings extremely common in the general population.
What I will do with this page is provide as much high quality learning resources as
possible so you are able to come to your own conclusion about whether you want to 
get involved or not. Reminder: this is not financial advice. Do your own research and
if you invest in a cryptocurrency, understand you can lose everything.
We will begin with a short description of what bitcoin is and then follow that up with
more resources you can use to extend your knowledge.
This isn't meant to be an extensive or comprehensive encylopedia of information,
rather the bare mimimum you need to begin to learn on you own how to manage your 
crypto portfolio.
Also, it's a work in progress, may have typos and lack links to sources.

## The basics of cryptocurrency (Bitcoin)

Bitcoin was the first and remains the most important cryptocurrency.
It was developed by an anonymous developer or developers called Satoshi 
Nakamoto and the whitepaper[1](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) describing 
the technical details underlying the Bitcoin software was released in 2008.
In 2009 the bitcoin network started, by Satoshi running the Bitcoin
node software.
In doing so, the first block of the blockchain was laid and over time many other
folks joined the network by running the software, growing the network further.

Being a currency, it allows participants to transact bitcoin (BTC) without
requiring the permission of a bank or other third party.
As Bitcoin is a decentralised network consisting of nodes and miners, there is
no central point of failure, which is important if it is to be resilient against
attacks from governments and other adversaries.

It is described as the internet of money [2] as it is an open and global network.
Transactions cannot be censored and are irreversible.
Folks can install a bitcoin wallet on their computer or smart phone and begin 
receiving and sending cash in a peer-to-peer fashion.
These transactions get stored on a public ledger called the blockchain.

So what is a blockchain anyway?
In simple terms it is just a list of all the transactions that have taken place
in the past, organised into chunks or "blocks".
The Bitcoin network is maintained by nodes who each have a copy of the 
blockchain and can therefore confirm the balances of each bitcoin holder.
As of Jan 2022, there are 14.5k bitcoin nodes online [3].

The process of confirming transactions is a complicated one because it needs to
mitigate the possibility of participants trying to double spend their funds.
Also, there is the problem of many nodes of the network needing to agree on the
contents of a block.
This is a major problem which has plagued digital cash systems for a long while
and has been termed the "Byzantine Generals Problem" [4].

The way that this was solved was to develop a system called mining, in which
a group of potential transactions are bundled into a block and then miners apply
their computational energy to "solve" the cryptographic SHA256 checksum (hash) 
of the block, so that the hash starts with a certain number of zeros [5].
For a miner to find the solution hash is relatively difficult so it is unlikely 
to be found simultaneously by two miners.
Once the solution is found, it is broadcast to the network, where it can be 
confirmed easily by nodes and the network can come to a consensus.
This process of block confirmation occurs on average very 10 minutes and the 
successful miner receives a block subsidy of 6.25 BTC but this subsidy is cut 
in half approximately every four years.
This has the effect of making BTC more scarce over time.
Mining is also the process by which BTC are minted into existence.
As of today, about 18 M of the total 21 M BTC have been mined [5].

In addition to the block subsidy, miners collect transaction fees which 
transactors use to prioritise their transactions over others.
It is possible to set a tranaction fee of zero, but those transactions will only 
be settled once the number of transactions in the queue falls to very low
levels (this occurs only rarely).
Currently the bitcoin median transaction fee is US$0.5 but has been known to be as 
high as $30 [6].

In the short term, reduction of the block subsidy leads to lower supply of BTC
being sold by miners on exchanges and this results in short term scarcity and
price "pumps" which gain massive momentum and resemble stock market bubbles, 
complete with spectacular price appreciation "bull runs" followed by crushing 
"bear markets" with drawdowns of 80 to 90% as seen in 2014/2015 and 2018/2019 [7].

One of the main points which makes bitcoin attractive to investors is the fact 
that the number of BTC that will ever exist is hard coded into the protocol.
There will never be more than 21 M BTC in existence. 
In this way, BTC is seen as "hard" money, which cannot be devalued by a 
government or central bank [8].
It is perceived by some as a hedge against future inflation, somewhat like gold
for the traditional investor, however there are some differences to gold that
need to be mentioned:

1. Gold has a tangible form, which has some industrial use, for example as 
jewellery or as a good conductor. Bitcoin doesn't have a material form which
may be considered a drawback but might also be considered a positive as 
explained below.

2. As BTC is immaterial, the only way to prove you own the bitcoin is to
possess the cryptographic keys to the "wallet" holding the BTC. This makes
confiscating BTC difficult (for example if the private keys exist only in the
memory of the owner).

3. Being immaterial, it enables BTC to be sent quickly. Whether the transaction
is small or large, the fee paid for the transaction is the same and takes the
same time to be confirmed.
Imagine sending $1 B worth of gold around the world in 1 hour, it simply 
wouldn't be possible. 

4. Gold is inflationary compared to BTC.
Indeed there is only a small amount of gold that is in existence in its refined
form as bullion or jewellery, but there are new geological deposits being found
every year, which means there is more flow of gold coming on to the market.
As technology improves, more deposits will be identified on land, in the sea bed
and maybe from asteroids or other moons or planets, who knows.
Meanwhile BTC will remain capped at 21 M.
In addition, unfortunate or careless bitcoiners lose their private keys and 
therefore access to their coins, meaning the actual supply of coins is less than
this and may even shrink over time.

So bitcoin is like digital gold, but it's properties make it better in many
respects.

Will bitcoin replace local fiat currencies any time soon?
Probably not, Gresham's law [9] indicates that "hard" money will be driven out of
circulation by "soft" money that can be easily printed by banks.
It makes more sense to hodl (save) bitcoin into the rather than use it for
purchases.
Cast your mind back to the first commercial bitcoin transaction, 10,000 BTC for
a pizza would be worth something like $4.6 billion at today's rates [10].

Therefore BTC will find itself to be a way for savers to preserve their 
purchasing power over long time frames, say decades (but with a diminishing 
rate of appreciation).
This simply cannot be achieved by currently in traditional finance, with term
deposit rates accruing interest below the consumer price index.
While BTC appears to be a good instrument for savers, it does experience massive 
swings in price, so investors may experience volatile swings in the portfolio 
value, which isn't for everyone.
Of course you can hodl through the severe bear markets, but if you are prepared 
with a strategy for navigating downturns and minimising your losses, the rewards
are attractive.
(I will write a separate article on strategies for that.)

Bitcoin's price appreciation appears to follow a power law, that means it fits
a straight line when both the time and price axes are log transformed.
See https://stats.buybitcoinworldwide.com/long-term-power-law/ and you will see
that price appreciation is decelerating over time [11].

It is a common assertion that cryptocurrencies are a ponzi scheme and that they 
are intrinsically worthless because they are backed by nothing.
The valuation of bitcoin is based on it's intangible monetary properties:

* durability: can be spent/transacted multiple times. 
However coins can become lost if the privete keys are lost.

* portability: it is a borderless network.

* fungibility: bitcoins are indistinguishable from one another.

* scarcity: limited to 21 M coins.

* divisibility: each coin can be divided into 100 million units, called satoshis.

* recognizability: BTC has its recognisable logo and culture.

Cryptography, mining, nodes and incentives play their part in supporting Bitcoin,
but there is nothing "backing" the value of bitcoin.
From the 1870s to 1971 minus a few other years, the US dollar was backed by gold,
meaning a Dollar could be redeemed for a stable unit of gold. [12]
Since 1971, the US Dollar is a fiat currency, meaning it no longer represents a set unit 
of gold.
The reasons why the gold standard was abandoned are complicated and probably need a longer
article, but suffice to say, that keeping the dollar pegged to gold gave the central banks 
and governments less power to print dollars.
Since going off the gold standard in 1971, the US dollar has lost 85% of its purchasing power 
(as at Jan 2022)[13].
This has also allowed banks to offer more loans, which has had the effect of pumping asset prices,
most notably real estate.
M2 money has expanded dramatically in recent years [14] in order to stimulate the economy,
but this extra cash and extremely low interest rates have benefitted mostly the already wealthy
are leading to ordinary workers losing substantial purchasing power.

So if the US Dollar is not backed by gold, what is holding up the greenback's value?

1. Demand for good and services from the USA and it's allies (including oil from Saudi Arabia) [15]

2. Demand for USD as a highly liquid asset and likely to keep it's value better than 
currencies of smaller nations.

3. The might of its millitary to intimidate smaller countries to use USD.

It is interesting to see El Salvador recently declare bitcoin as legal tender and 
incorporate it as a legitimate part of its economy [16].
This is in large part due to a lack of it's own national currency and reliance on the
US dollar as the local currency.
For a long time people have said that bitcoin won't be used in a day to day sense 
because the network can only process about 3 transactions per section and in times of
demand the transaction fees can escalate to over $20 which is impractical.
However the El Salvador adoption of bitcoin was enabled by the lightning network.
This is a "layer 2" system which allows for tranactions to occur off-chain [17].
Lightning transactions incur only tiny fees of a few cents, which allows for interesting
applications like microtransactions, tipping and streaming money.
The development of the lightning network and other layer 2 solutions reduce the demand
for on-chain transactions and reduce the transaction fees for everyone.

El Salvador's adoption of bitcoin is an interesting experiment might encourage other small
countries to adopt BTC or other digital currencies.
On the other hand, some governments have tried to regulate, ban and restrict cryptocurrencies 
due to the possibility that they may destabilise the local currency.
These regulations are typically focused on the pain points for digital currency, which are
the exchanges and bank transfers to those exchanges.
These can indeed stifle confidence in such currencies but the rusted-on supporters will still 
keep their holdings in cold storage until regulations are lifted, or they will move to a more 
permissive juristiction.
Legistators will be able to contrast harsh and friendly stances on digital assets, it is possible
that juristictions friendly to digital currencies will see an influx of entrepreneurs and new 
investment which will stimulate their economies in contrast to the brain drain and escape of 
capital from restrictive juristictions.
Just like the adoption of other types of technology, countries will try to gain dominance
by fostering blockchain entrepreneurs and recommending ownership.
Potentially, central banks will stockpile BTC in order to stabilise their own local currency.

## Altcoins

Since Bitcoin was described there have been thousands of other cryptocurrencies 
created.
Some of these have features such as enhanced privacy, transaction speed, or smart 
contract capabilities which give them some unique benefits over Bitcoin.
Some of these currencies are demonstrations of real-world innovations and will fill
important niches. 
Other coins were created as jokes, or memes and have no real benefits (think DOGE),
while other coin projects were outright scams.

Many people coming into the space are attracted to altcoins because they feel they
missed the boat in investing in bitcoin, and would rather get in early with a smaller 
project which has a higher upside potential.
It is partially true that altcoins have higher potential gains (especially the 
low-caps), however you need to understand that the risk is higher with them as well.
Just take a look at the top 10 altcoins in 2017, and where they are now.
Search for cryptos like LTC, DASH, XVG, XRP.
Some of those projects suffered catastrophic losses in excess of 95%.
Some of those coins have just recovered their previous all time high, while others 
remain beaten down, while BTC is well above the 2017 high (approx 3x).
Why is that?
Couple reasons, firstly even though bitcoin is volatile, it is considered a safer bet 
than altcoins.
Secondly, Bitcoin enjoys a larger community of developers, who can add new features to
the network, develop new wallets and integration into the existing financial system.
Bitcoin is also able to integrate features from other projects.
Remember that the concept of "layer 2", small transactions with extremely low fees 
using the lightning network was first enabled on Litecoin, before it was applied to
Bitcoin [17].

I'm not saying that altcoins are all a bad investment, just that the risks are higher.
Even though a project could be fundamentally valuable doesn't mean it will perform 
well. 
As the market is driven more by emotions than fundamentals it will continue to be
unpredictable and volatile.
One piece of advice I can give is to see what projects are getting software developers
involved.
Clearly the Ethereum network is a focus for cutting edge applications such as 
decentralised finance (defi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) which will innovate 
banking, finance and other aspects of our life. 
But keep in mind that Ethereum is undergoing major upgrades such as moving
to proof-of-stake, along with upgrades to enable more transactions which have a chance 
of failing.
Aside from this, Ethereum is a really interesting network because it invites others to
build applications on top of it and use the Ethereum network.
For example the cryptos Chainlink (LINK) and Synthetix (SNX) are tokens on the Ethereum
system.
If you have an Ethereum wallet like Metamask, you can keep not only ETH, but also LINK,
SNX, other ERC-20 tokens and even NFTs.
If you transact tokens or enter into smart contracts on the ETH network, there are gas
fees which need to be paid in order to prioritise it sufficiently so it is executed in
a timely way.
Interestingly, transaction fees on the Ethereum network currently are 5-10X higher than
for Bitcoin, which is an indication of how well the Ethereum network has been able to
on-board many other projects, but these extremely high fees are a deterrent to 
newcomers and have led to the popularity of competitors such as Binance smart chain,
Solana, Polkadot, Avalanche and many others.
As the competition for supremecy is so fierce, it is likely that there will be big 
winners and losers.
It is possible that any of these competitors to Ethereum could overtake it, but in my 
opinion this is unlikely as Ethereum has the biggest critical mass of developers.
If these upgrades roll out as planned into ETH2.0, then Ethereum throughput will expand 
dramatically, gas fees will crash and Ethereum competitor networks will fall 
significantly behind.

From this, you should appreciate that Ethereum is in strong competition with other 
smart contract chains and it could end up as winner-take-all.
On the other hand, there are no serious store-of-value competitors to bitcoin.
In my humble opinion, bitcoin is in a class of it own and should be the bedrock of any
investment portfolio.

## Lending and borrowing

Celsius, Ledn, Nexo, Blockfi and other centralised players will allow you to deposit
your crypto and accumulate interest.
This incurrs some risk, but is a strategy to passively grow an investment.
These players may also allow you to take out a fiat loan, using crypto as collateral.
Decentralised protocols (eg: [Compound Finance](https://compound.finance/)) also exist
and offer borrowing and lending services but some with lower KYC/AML regulations.
