2022 has been an absolutely crazy year in the cryptocurrency space.
Bitcoin began the year at US$46k and closed it at $16.5k marking one of the
worst calendar years for the premier cryptocurrency since it's inception (a 64% drop).

Even though cryptocurrency markets have been plummeting, there have been significant
opportunities, especially for short traders and for those who sold a chunk of their
stack while the price was in the >$40k range.
These folks will be able to rebuy at much lower prices and grow their stack
significantly, as compared to "hodlers".

Here at MDZ Analytics, we pride ourselves on providing a fantastic set of
cryptocurrency market analyses and indicators, so let's look back at the market
indicators of 2022 and see how they performed for BTC, ETH and XMR.
To make this analysis work I performed backtesting based optimisation of indicators
using data up to end of 2021, and then traced the performance of these indicators in
2022.

For an explanation of the indicators, visit the [MDZ analytics homepage](mdz-analytics.com).

Detailed analysis and parameters used can be found [here](mdz-analytics.com/year_review/).

## Bitcoin

Below we can tabulate the different strategies in the period 2013-2022 and just 2022.
HODL yielded a 377x increase in the 2013-2022 timeframe, but some of the indicators gave
significantly higher returns than that.
In 2022, BTC lost 64% of its value, meaning holders retained only 36% of their USD value.
Those who sold at the end of 2021 and stayed out of the market fared comparatively well,
retaining 100% of their USD value.

Regarding the indicators, their performance was between 0.40 and 1.0, which importantly
exceeded the HODL returns.
The poorest performing indicators were KST, TSI, DC, Stoch and dRSI.
SMA cross was marginally better at 0.57, followed by SMA at 0.75.
At the top end, the EMA was better at retaining value at 0.85, along with the
EMA cross at 0.88, but the overall best performer was the DMI which flashed a sell
signal in 2021 at $53.6k.

| Strategy | Total returns | 2022 trades | 2022 returns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HODL | 377 |0 | 0.36 |
| DMI | 2.5x | 0 | 1.00 |
| DC | 1.3x | 7 | 0.46 |
| dRSI | 0.87x | 12 | 0.49 |
| Stoch | 1.3x | 9 | 0.49 |
| TSI | 1.5x | 8 | 0.43 |
| KST | 2.4x | 11 | 0.40 |
| SMA | 1.2x | 7 | 0.75 |
| EMA | 1.6x | 7 | 0.85 |
| SMAcross | 3.1x | 6 | 0.57 |
| EMAcross | 3.4x | 1 | 0.88 |

One of the highlights from this analysis was that overall, strtegies that flash less frequently
performed better, and secondly it underscores the importance of EMA ribbons in BTCs price action.

## Ethereum

<img src="images/ETHUSDT_2023-01-04_22-09-30.png" alt="ETH price action 2022" height="450" width="600" border="0" />

Ethereum is a newer coin than BTC and so since listing on coinmarketcap.com it has recorded a
larger appreciation (1372x).
It is also a more volatile market, meaning that our indicators outperformed holders since 2015.
While ETH lost 67% of its value over the calendar year, adherents to our indicator set would
have fared much better.
KST fared the worst at 0.55.
The best performing strategies were Stoch, EMA, DMI, and SMA retaining in excess of 68% of
capital.

| Strategy | Total returns | 2022 trades | 2022 returns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HODL | 1372 | 0 | 0.33 |
| DMI | 10.1x | 7 | 0.75 |
| DC | 14.2x | 9 | 0.60 |
| dRSI | 4.2x | 12 | 0.60 |
| Stoch | 8.1x | 10 | 0.68 |
| TSI | 5.2x | 8 | 0.69 |
| KST | 6.8x | 8 | 0.55 |
| SMA | 16.6x | 8 | 1.0 |
| EMA | 5.1x | 8 | 0.70 |
| SMAcross | 12.5x | 6 | 0.69 |
| EMAcross | 14.2x | 6 | 0.63 |

## Monero

<img src="images/XMRUSDT_2023-01-04_22-09-45.png" alt="XMR price action 2022" height="450" width="600" border="0" />

In contrast to BTC and ETH, XMR had a less severe drawdown of only 36% in 2022, which I think is
due to its undervaluation relative to utility and demonstrated real-world growth in 2022.

Again, we can see that the trend of the indicators with lower frequency signals performing better
continued, with DMI and SMA cross performing best, retaining >83% of capital.

The poorest were the EMA, dRSI and SMA, retaining less than 40% of capital.

Reasons why some of these indicators performed worse than the "buy and hold" strategy include
 (i) the XMR/BTC pair is more influential, so BTC moves relative to USD influence the
available liquidity into coins like XMR; and (ii) that while overall XMR price was sideways in
USD terms there were some significant volatility events that could be construed as "bull traps",
where the price action turned positive temporarily, followed by short violent downturns.

| Strategy | Total returns | 2022 trades | 2022 returns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HODL | 142 | 0 | 0.64 |
| DMI | 4.7x | 3 | 0.84 |
| DC | 2.9x | 3 | 0.74 |
| dRSI | 0.1x | 22 | 0.26 |
| Stoch | 2.8x | 6 | 0.46 |
| TSI | 4.4x | 12 | 0.56 |
| KST | 16.3x | 11 | 0.58 |
| SMA | 0.24x | 18 | 0.37 |
| EMA | 0.25x | 18 | 0.27 |
| SMAcross | 11.8x | 1 | 0.83 |
| EMAcross | 3.9x | 4 | 0.65 |

## Conclusion

Overall, this analysis shows that trading using these indicators was superior than simply buying
and holding.
This is a validation of backtesting based indicator optimisation and a good reason why you
should incorporate these indicators into your own strategy.

Here we've demonstrated that low frequency indicators perform better during bear markets.
The SMA cross, EMA cross and DMI all outperformed hodlers, while dRSI, KST and TSI
performed relatively poorly.

Those hodling XMR fared relatively better than those with BTC or ETH, potentially due to
the lower speculative demand of XMR, together with XMRs real world adoption on DNMs.
Based on this it might be wise to adjust your long term holdings by increasing the alloation
towards XMR away from BTC and ETH.
Nevertheless there are some risks associated with XMR such as delistings and regulatory
scrutiny which could sour market sentiment.

It will be useful in future to determine whether these signals can perform well with leveraged
longs and shorts.
