## 10 reasons why Monero will be adopted, not Bitcoin

I've written previously on the benefits of Bitcoin and it's major flaw, which is privacy.
Here I want to unpack further on why I reckon Monero is the most likely to obtain international 
widespread adoption.

### War on cash

Around the world, it seems cash transactions are becoming more rare.
Even before the pandemic, countries like Sweden already had the majority of in-person transactions via
credit based transfers rather than cash.
When the pandemic occurred, the fraction of cash transactions dropped significantly in places like the
US and Australia due to perceptions on hygiene, with many retailers deciding not to accept cash anymore.

This is a problem for many reasons, especially when it comes to privacy - cash is the method which 
leaves the least tracable data and curtailing it will prevent people from transacting in a private way.
Banks and credit card companies will be able to collect client data and use it to generate revenue.

Secondly, this is an issue about equity as not all people can have a bank or credit card.
People under a certain age cannot open a full bank account or get a credit card, yet they have every 
right to buy most goods and services.
People travelling internationally prefer to obtain physical cash as they don't want to be hit with
international currency conversion fees at each merchant, and don't want to obtain a an account or card
for a relatively short stay.

As people use cash less, authorities will continue to put caps on what is legal with cash.
For example, in the EU, cash transactions >â‚¬3000 are not allowed, and transactions larger than this 
need to be conducted via debit cards. 
In Israel, this limit is now ~US$1785.
What is concerning is that these are hard caps and as inflation takes its toll, it is unlikely that
the caps will be increased, which means eventually cash will be useful only for increasingly small
transactions.
If these limits remain, in the long run cash is doomed.

On the horizon, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are poised to become the main legal tender,
and will allow central authorities to surveil populations and control them via only allowing individuals
to transact with approved merchants.

### Customer privacy

As a consumer you want to protect your sensitive information.



* Merchant privacy

* SOV privacy

* Monero's design enables L1 scaling and cheap transactions

* Monero's tail emission will guarantee network security

* Tail emission will guarantee network longevity

* Halvenings are stupid, gradual tail emission is better

* Mining is possible on consumer grade hardware

* Monero thrives in adversarial environment

## What adoption will look like

* Illicit uses: Dark net markets and ransomware

* Coin cards

* Global south: hyperinflationary and repressive states

* Number of nodes and transactions

* Moving up the market cap rank
